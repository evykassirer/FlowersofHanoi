FlowersofHanoi
==============

This was an assignment in grade 12 computer science.
We were instructed to make a towers of hanoi implementation with graphics.
I decided to make it look like flowers, hence floweres of hanoi.
I used C++, and Allegro for the GUI.

Most of this code is graphics and user interacton.
There is a separate file for each size of leaf (the tower has bigger leaves
on the bottom and higher on the top). 
leafON means for the uesr interaction part, they have selected that leaf.

If you go to the instructions page, there will be a time interval during which 
you cannot press okay. This is on purpose, because I want you to read it!
You need to click on dirt piles, not the leaf itself (this was easier to code).

Computer can solve the puzzle itself on three different speeds and with up to 9 leaves,
and will count the number of moves. If you're on slow and trying to get to the menu,
be sure to click and hold because there is no check for clicks as the computer pauses 
between moving leaves.

Hope you enjoy playing!
